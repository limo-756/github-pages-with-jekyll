## About me

![my-photo](assets/self-image.JPG "Anurag Sharma")

Hi, my name is Anurag and I am a Software Engineer who focuses on content related to software engineering and machine learning!  

I grew up in the great state of Rajasthan in India. From an early age, I always loved math. I started coding in college. I found it a creative way to apply the same type of logical thinking skills that I enjoyed with math. This influenced me to study software development and machine learning and ultimately create blogs to share some things that I have learned along the way.

## Hobbies

I love coding and automating/solving daily life issues. I also love doing all sorts of active things. I like to play table tennis & badminton as well as run, skate, and surf. In addition to sports, I am a board game enthusiast, I like playing chess. I also love watching Anime.
