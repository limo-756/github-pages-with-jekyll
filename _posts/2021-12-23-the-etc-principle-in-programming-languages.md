Challenge from The Pragmatic Programmer - Explain how do programming languages and programming paradigms (OOP, FP, Reactive, etc,) follow the ETC principle? What are there big positives and negatives when it comes to writing code? When coding how can you eliminate the negatives? 

1. C++/C
C was built to support functional programming paradigms. Then C++ was introduced inspired by the swiss knife that supports multiple paradigms like OOP, functional.
Both of these languages were improvement in over earlier languages. Hence they followed the ETC principle. They get the programmers rid of goto, which was a nightmare to code and understand. 

2. Functional paradigms
It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values.
It made easy to code than previous imperative languages, but it does not restrict functions from modifying inputs. Hence, it leads it harder to maintain code. There is a pure functional programming paradigm that says that function should never modify its inputs.
It is good for making small codes.

3. OOP paradigms
It is based on encapsulating data with functions that operate on it. It removes the shortcomings of Functional paradigms.
It makes code makes easier to code as it encapsulates the requirements in terms of objects which is more analogous to the real world.
It has a downside that it needs more lines of code than functional needs.

4. Java
Java purely supports OOP. It is one of the best languages for making large systems.
