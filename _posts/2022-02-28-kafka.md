Kafka provides various guarantees such as the ability to process events exactly-once.

### What is a Topic in Kafka?
A topic is a way to organise all the events into multiple categories like a file in a folder.

### What is a broker in kafka?
Broker stores the messages in kafka.

### How does Kafka Works?
Kafka is a distributed system consisting of servers and clients that communicate via a high-performance TCP network protocol. It can be deployed on bare-metal hardware, virtual machines, and containers in on-premise as well as cloud environments. 

### Persistence in Kafka?
Kafka persists data directly on disks. They use sequential reads and writes to achieve very high throughput


### Kafka APIs
1. Admin API - To manage and inspect topics, brokers and other Kafka topics.
2. Producer API - To publish a stream of events to 1 or more topics
3. Consumer API - To subscribe and read data from topics.
4. Streams API - It is used to achieve realtime stream processing. It provide high level functions like transformation, stateful operations like aggregations and joins, windowing, processing based on event-time, and more.
5. Connect API - It provides connectors to external system like DB, S3 etc. to get event streams from them
