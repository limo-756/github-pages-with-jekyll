1. C++/C
C was build to support functional programming paradigms. Then C++ was introduced inspired from swiss knife that support multiple paradigms like OOP, functional.
Both of these languages were improvement in over earlier languages. Hence they followed ETC principle. They get the programmers rid of goto, which was a nightmare to code and understand. 

2. Functional paradigms
It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values.
It made easy to code than previous imperative languages, but it does not restrict functions from modify inputs. Hence, it leads to harder to maintain code.
There is pure functional programing paradigms which says that function should not never modify its inputs.
It is good for making small code.

3. OOP paradigms
It is based on encapsulating data with functions which operate on it. It removes the short commings of Functional paradigms.
It makes code makes easier to code as it encapsulates the requirements in terms of objects which is more analogus to real world.
It has a downside that it needs more lines of code than functional need.

4. Java
Java purely support OOP. It is one of the best languages for making large system.
