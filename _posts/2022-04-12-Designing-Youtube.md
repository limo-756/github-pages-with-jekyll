### Requirements and goal of the system
#### Functional Goals
1. Users should be able to upload videos.
2. Users should be able to view and share videos.
3. Users should be able to search videos using title of the video.
4. Users should be able to view and add comments to video.
5. System should record video stats like views, likes, dislikes etc.

#### Non-Functional Goals
1. System should be highly available, consistency can take a hit in view of availability. If some users dosen't see a video for a while its fine.
2. Video streaming should be in real-time without lag.
3. System should be reliable and no data should be lost.
