What is the ETC principle?
Every code change that you make should be easier to change/modify in the future. As good designs are easier to change than bad designs.

How to incorporate the ETC principle in life?
Whenever you make a code change ask yourself. Did the change that I made make the overall system easier or harder to change?

What to do when you don't have any clue about what type of form change make take in the future?
1. Ask yourself is it easy to change? Is it easily replaceable? It's a way to keep code decoupled and cohesive.
2. Whenever you make a choice add a tag in the code, that way you will be able to reflect upon your choices when the actual change comes. And It might help you next time when you reach a similar situation.

Challenge for me
Add an extension in Sublime and Intellij whenever I commit, it will show me ETC principal. This way I will be able to incorporate it into my life.
