Critical Thinking on Projects and new leaning
1. Ask 5 why's 
This is a tip from consulting. They repeatedly ask questions like A 4-year-old until they reach the root cause. Whenever you read new stuff ask why until you reach an answer.

2 Ask who this benefit
Asking this question will enable you to choose the best path that aligns with yourself.

3 Ask when and where to apply this technique? why this technique should work?
This is a must. You should know the advantages, drawbacks of techniques that you use to be able to make intelligent compromises.
And don't stop with first-order thinking, follow up what will happen after that?

4 Ask what is the context?
Everything happens in a context, there are no universal solutions (1 solution for all problems). For Eg If you read an article on best practices. Then the good question to ask best for who? What are the pre-requisites? What are the consequences long term and short term?

5. Why is this a problem?
Is there an underlying model? How does the underlying model work?
