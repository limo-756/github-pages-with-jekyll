Why do Software Developers need effective communication?
We communicate our thoughts in code so that the machine can understand them and execute them. We communicate with external clients, Product Managers to get requirements
and specifications. Without effective communication any idea or piece of code is useless.

Ways to improve our communication

1. Know your Audience
To communicate effectively, we need to understand audience interest, capacity, and background. For Eg: A software nerd giving a lecture on some arcane technology to management people. This is not communication, it's just talking and it could be annoying for others.
The trick for these situations is to gather info about our audience by asking questions, checking their body language and facial expressions.

2. Know what you want to say
Whenever you send a message/email to someone else, first plan and outline what you want to communicate. And then proofread it to verify are communicating what you want to communicate in the language they understand?

3. Choose your moment
Always ask yourself is it a good time to talk about...?
For eg: If your boss's relative has died and he is in bad mood then your request for RAM up-gradation for your laptop will be improper.
But if there is some DB failure in your org and you suggest some good ideas around it then your manager will listen to you keenly.

4. Make it look good
Invest in excel, docs skills. Make your content look good, there are only a bunch of commands that you need to learn for your presentation to look appealing.

5. Involve your Audience
If you are preparing a doc for the support team then involve them in the process and ask them for feedback. This way you will build a better working relationship and the final draft will probably look better.

6. Be a listener
For others to listen to you, you need to listen to them as well. Encourage them to ask you questions, turn the meeting into a dialog and it will make your points more effectively

7. Get Back to People
When someone does not read or reply to your message then it feels rude. Same way, respond to other people's emails, messages, voicemails, etc. Even if the response is simple "I will get back to you later". Keeping people informed makes them forgiving of the occasional slip and makes them you haven't forgotten them.

8. Documentation
Documents the reasons and options for choosing a particular design, lib, etc, engineering trade-offs so that other programmers can understand your code later. But never document what it does as it is the violation of the DRY principal
